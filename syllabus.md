# IGME-201, New Media Interactive Design and Algorithmic Problem Solving III, Fall 2019: Syllabus

## Course Catalog Description

*This is the third course in the software development sequence for new media interactive development students. Students further their exploration of problem solving and abstraction through coverage of topics such as GUI development, events, file I/O, networking, threading, and other advanced topics related to the design and development of modern dynamic applications. Programming assignments are an integral part of the course.*

## Course Goals and Objectives
At the end of this course, a student should be able to implement moderately large programming projects either individually and/or in a team. Specifically, a student should:
-	Demonstrate the ability to translate UI/UX requirements into working programs with an emphasis on usability and presentation.
-	Demonstrate the ability to construct and use linear data structures to design software solutions. Data structures include lists, stacks and queues.
-	Demonstrate the ability to design and implement software applications that use event-driven graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms.
-	Describe how exceptions work, explain their uses and employ them in their own designs.
-	Define inheritance and interface relationships and appropriately use design patterns in their own program designs.
-	Read and write files from within a software application.
-	Demonstrate the ability to construct multi-threaded programs that may run on multi-core computers.
-	Implement software applications that use basic networking protocols.

We will assess all of this work with in-class exercises, homework, projects, and exams, as discussed below.

## Course Materials and Communication
There is no textbook assigned for this course, but I will be providing lecture notes and in-class examples from _Beginning C#_ by Karli Watson, et al.

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via GitHub and myCourses, and you will also be learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage your own project files.

myCourses will be used for announcements, links to course content, quizzes and exams, assignment submissions, and grading.

A course-wide Discord server has been created to provide an avenue of communication between professors, teaching assistants, and students. There is a channel on it for your section as well as help channels for different topic areas.  You should use Discord as your primary way for getting in touch with your professor (unless instructed otherwise) and use email only for ‘official business’ where a more formal record is required.  The Discord server will be either deleted or wiped clean at the end of the semester, so be sure to ‘save’ any great piece of information you see on it elsewhere.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early unless specifically dismissed).

## Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Project (25%)
-	Presentation-rich Front-end User Application

### Exams (40%)
These exams consist of all manner of questions styles (multiple choice, true/false, matching, etc) as well as "write some code" questions. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
-	Unit Test 1 (8%)
-   Unit Test 2 (8%)
-   Unit Test 3 (8%)
-	Final Exam (16%) - will be given during finals week.

### Homework & other assignments (30%)
Homeworks, in-class exercises, checkpoints, and other assignments are essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one Practice Exercise per class meeting. Keep an eye on the myCourses Assignments section for the due dates.

Assignments never submitted on myCourses, or submitted LATE without a valid excuse will receive a score of ZERO for that assignment. (Procrastination is not a valid excuse). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor in **advance** of the due date either by email or during office hours.

### Attendance & Participation (5%)
Note: Each absence is a loss of 1 of 5 points (and thus 1% off of your final grade). **Each additional absence beyond 5 is 5% off of final average**. Arriving late is 1/2 absence. Your phone must be off or in airplane mode and out of sight for the duration of each lecture. Facebooking or similar off-task activity during lectures or demos will count as an absence for the day. If you have a legitimate reason for missing class, notify your professor in advance of the class meeting.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, solely for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed at the end of week 11, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty.

### Academic Dishonesty
The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html

## Important RIT Deadlines
-	Last day of add/drop is Tuesday, September 3, 2019.
-	Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Friday, November 8, 2019.
-	You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade.

## Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class, via Discord, or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
